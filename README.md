# assignment-2

# We decided to make three extra minigames along the challange 4, but we made challange 4 a tutorial with extra features

# Hoor worked on game 1 and is responsible for working on the main menu UI. The branch that game 1 was pushed to is branch 1

# Shahad worked on game 3 and the tutorial (previously called game2 but we changed so that the games order are more appropriate), the branch responsible for game3 is branch2

# Abdulla completed challange 4 and worked on game 2 (previously called game3), which were pushed to main and branch3 respectively

# We all had to commit changes first to the branches before merging it to main, we made sure our files were seperate so we don't face troubles while merging the branches together with main
